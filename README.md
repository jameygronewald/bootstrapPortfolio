# Bootstrap Portfolio

---

## Description
This is my responsive portfolio built using Bootstrap. The app reconfigures to a new layout depending on the viewport of the device being used. 

The homepage provides my professional statement. The portfolio page provides descriptions and links for my projects. The contact page provides information for getting in touch with me and a link to my resume.
